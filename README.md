# Landing Page Package

This package will create a homepage for logged out users to the website & run through the signup funnel of accepting the offer.

The email will send a link to /verify/007 and a code of "42069" that will be entered on that page to verify the mail address. The requests table will have the email address, a submission number (incremented by 7), verified timestamp in addition to id & otheer timestamps.

The next page in the tunnel flow will ask "What name should I call you?" and then a paragraph field to provide 1-3 sentences on the type of AI Agent you want me to build.

The following page should have checkboxes for deesired levels of security & functionality:

- Private Data
- Encrypted communication
- Decentralized
- Ability to Make Payments
- Open Source LLM
- Fully Open Source or Proprietary Code

Next page should be an option to enter a cell phone number or telegram username.

Final page should be creating a password to login.

Email will then be sent to schedule a meeting. The meeting page will have our custom calandly style laravel package that I also need to create.

I want to initially create a quick impromptu video to include on that email that adresses them by their requested name & a quick ovrview of what they requested their agent to be & top priorities for the agent. Thee email will just have a preeview image of the video & it will be embedded above the calendar link.

This should set me up as the consultant & developer for creating their AI Agent using open source code that I customize or create for them. I will advise them through that process & they will receive email updates & have a timeline & github link & pr/commits info on their agent creation page.
